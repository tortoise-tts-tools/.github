## TTS API _With Streaming Support_ Coming Soon

We plan to open-source a web-based API and SaaS framework (we probably won't host it)!

Here's how it works:

1. An instance is started
2. Someone calls the API endpoint: `/api/stream/....`
3. The server starts a live audio stream and pushes updates to the stream
4. The browser plays the stream

Note: if the server isn't fast enough, the stream will be paused.

### Interested?

We're planning to open-source it. Interested? Please register your interest by [starring this repository](https://github.com/tortoise-tts-tools/tts-api). Ask questions [here](https://github.com/tortoise-tts-tools/tts-api/discussions).
